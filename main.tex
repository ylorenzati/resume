\cvsection[page1sidebar]{About me}
	\quad I used to be a Java dev but I quickly moved onto \textbf{DevOps} subjects because I believe that to \textbf{deliver quality} software, 
	we need to \textbf{automate} with the same quality.
	\\
	\medskip
	\quad I'm also interested by others subjects such as \textbf{performance analysis}, \textbf{scalability} and \textbf{resilience} in software architecture.
	\\
	\medskip
	\quad I try my best to promote and contribute to \textbf{open source}.

%% If the NEXT page doesn't start with a \cvsection but you'd
%% still like to add a sidebar, then use this command on THIS
%% page to add it. The optional argument lets you pull up the
%% sidebar a bit so that it looks aligned with the top of the
%% main column.
